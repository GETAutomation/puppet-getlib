# GETlib Shared Module

This module contains functions and resources used by GET-Automation team modules, and is heavily influenced by ShellFu and StdMod community modules. This shared module is a requirement for all GET-Automation team modules.

This module should not be called directly, and provides nothing but functions and resources.
